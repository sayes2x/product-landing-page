    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p class="text">Using sensor, microprocessor, and battery technology pioneered for smartphones, Aware Smart Guitars combine your playing with data provided by sensors to alter the output of your instrument in real time. The sound posibilities are virtually limitless,
      bound only by your skill on the instrument and your imagination. The Aware Smart Guitar App is open source and supported by a vibrant development community. If you have an idea that is not yet implemented in the software or the many avaliable plug-ins,
      chances are that somebody is aleady working on it. If not, you can always start the effort.</p>
    <p class="text">Aware Smart Guitars are designed first to be musical instruments. You don't want to play a computer, you want to play guitar. All sensors are unobtrusive and all communication with the software is wireless. From the audience your instrument looks
      no different than a standard guitar, with the exception of the outstanding quality of design. The sensors that allow unprecented control over the sonic characteristics of your instrument are visible only to the performer</p>
